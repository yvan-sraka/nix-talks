## `whoami`

I am currently working as a Senior DevX Engineer at IOG, contributing to Rust, Nix, and Haskell upstream tooling.

I designed the Rust/Haskell interoperability tools suite [`cargo-cabal`](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/cargo-cabal) and [`hs-bindgen`](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/hs-bindgen), the Nix [`contracts`](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/contracts) library, and am maintaining the [`Cabal`](https://github.com/haskell/cabal), [`devx`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/devx) and [`haskell.nix`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix) build infrastructures.

You can find me on Mastodon: **https://functional.cafe/@yvan**

## **What's on the menu?**

1. **Reproducible:** no more _"but it worked on my machine"_ ;
2. **Declarative:** _"one configuration that rules all"_, set up a new machine is just one `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+V` (or rather `git clone && nixos-rebuild switch`) away ;
3. **Immutable:** an evil program couldn't any more change your system without you even notice... Also, your system doesn't _"get old"_ because of partially uninstalled programs, so you need to reinstall it...
4. **Atomic transitions:** no more _"my system is broken because power got cut while the update"_! And, if your system is broken, you can always _"restore a previous version"_ in one command!

## 0. **What's the Nix?**

- The Nix **language**
- The Nix **package manager**
- The NixOS **linux distribution**
- The `nixpkgs`\footnote{nixpkgs.lib is the standard library of Nix language.} (Nix packages) **monorepo**

## _Interlude:_ **The Nix language**

I don't have the time to teach the Nix language here... but it could be learn in 1-hour of your time.
It's really a small language, you can think about it as _"JSON + functions"_. Here's an example:
```nix
with (import <nixpkgs> {});
mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    pandoc
    texlive.combined.scheme-full
  ];
}
```
**Advice:** Learn\footnote{Read https://code.tvl.fyi/about/nix/nix-1p ;)} the Nix syntax and semantic before starting to copy-paste others NixOS configurations.

## 1. **Reproducible:** _Beyond the bash script..._

**Consider this script:**

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash
apt update
apt install python3
python3 ./myserver.py
```

**What could go wrong?**

- Having not the exact same `python3` version...
- Having a different `PATH` (with a custom `python3` binary)...
- Having `python3` dynamically linked against a different `glibc`...

## _Interlude:_ **But Docker is already fine! _right?_**

With Docker, **what you distribute is the image** (what `docker push`/`pull` does) not the `Dockerfile`, and it's a big binary. **Building the image is not reproducible**\footnote{A workaround would be to use Alpine Linux and to pin the version of the system used.}.

## 2. **Declarative:** _I can build whatever I want with Nix!_

Nix let's you describe **derivations** _(recipes)_, that can be anything:

- A binary\footnote{Where to download it or its sources and how to build it.}, a script ;
- A developer environment ;
- A Docker or KVM image ;
- The content of `/etc/`\footnote{That's what NixOS options does!} or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` on my machine, e.g.:

```nix
programs.git = {
  enable = true;
  userName = "Yvan Sraka";
  userEmail = "yvan@sraka.xyz";
  signing.key = "370B823A2A0C7478";
  signing.signByDefault = true;
}
```

## _Interlude:_ **`nixpkgs` (Nix packages)**

The real value of Nix lives in `nixpkgs` (more than 100 000 package\footnote{NixOS is actually the Linux distribution with the most packages availables.}, 10 000 contributors and 500 000 commits):

- `nixpkgs` contains package definitions, but also NixOS options, that are indexed here https://search.nixos.org ;
- `home-manager` isn't part of `nixpkgs` but let you populate `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`\footnote{Which is set to \$HOME/.config on most systems.}.

The idea here is to wrote all your configurations in one same language (Nix).

## _Interlude:_ extract of my `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```nix
programs.zsh = {
  enable = true;
  enableCompletion = true;
  promptInit = ''
    # Best defaults are https://grml.org/zsh/
    source ${pkgs.grml-zsh-config}/etc/zsh/zshrc
  '';
};

programs.tmux = {
  enable = true;
  extraConfig = builtins.fetchurl {
    url = "https://git.grml.org/f/grml-etc-core/etc/tmux.conf";
    sha256 = "1ysb9jzhhpz160kwcf4iafw7qngs90k3rgblp04qhz5f8gjy6z03";
  };
};
```

## 3. **Immutable:** _`/nix/store/everything`_

- Everything is symbolic linking that point to the `/nix/store/` (Nix store) ;
- Only the `nix-daemon` can write the `/nix/store/` ;
- A `/nix/store/` object is called a **derivation** ;
- Derivations are garbage-collected when no symbolic link points to them ;
- What about dynamic linking? `patchelf`\footnote{A small utility to modify the dynamic linker and RPATH of ELF executables https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf} to the rescue!

## _Interlude:_ **How does that even work?**

In previous example, `${pkgs.grml-zsh-config}` is `/nix/store/bn226m74zgwdpdnp12lq01z89wh0mzn0-grml-zsh-config-0.19.6/etc/zsh/zshrc`

NixOS expression can only reference `/nix/store/` objects or external resources locked with a checksum hash (e.g. with `builtins.fetchurl`).
That means that we control the **complete dependencies closure of our derivation** _(recipe)_, so we control also all systems dependency it rely on\footnote{What, e.g., package-lock.json does not.}.

Finally, **derivations are realized in a sandbox**, or in other words, recipes are built in an environment where there is no access to network, or to environment variables or to your home directory. This ensure that those builds are **fully-reproducible**.

## 4. **Atomic transitions:** _It's magic!_

- Upgrade system, install a program is just a change in symbolic linking ;
- Grub offers you to choose at boot the generation of your system you want to use and NixOS just has to change a few symbolic links ;
- That means you can have several versions of `node` or `glibc` on your system without any conflict ;
- That allows throwable developer environment (or per-directory, e.g. with `direnv` automation)!

# \Huge DEMO

## Drawbacks

- The macOS\footnote{e.g. there is no sandbox on macOS...} support isn't that great.
- Flakes experimental feature, that constraint the hermeticity\footnote{Nix expressions could no longer read ENV variables.}, is controversial and fragment the ecosystem.
- Complexity... there are a lot more Nix feature I don't mentioned yet, like **remote builders** or **binary caches**, and a lot of concepts to grasp to build a right mental model on Nix, but arguably that's also because it's full of great features!
