What's Nix again?

Nix is a package manager and a configuration language (pure and lazy) that describes a package or a developer environment as the complete list of its dependencies.

---

By complete list of its dependencies, it means it fetchs (and locks) recursively the whole tree of anything you need to build a given package.

---

Nix puts everything in a big `/nix/store`, so packages can share dependencies, and at the same time you could have, e.g., 2 conflicting `glibc` versions on your machine.

---

Nix introduces `patchelf`\footnote{https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf} to control the path of every dynamic library that would depend on a binary!

---

So, one `.nix` file (hermetic) means one perfectly reproducible developer environment.

---

```nix
let hash = "9402c27069da5c5217648ec9cfe6d437aeadb79d";
in { pkgs ? import (fetchTarball
  "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/${hash}.tar.gz")
  { } }:

pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    pkgs.python3
  ];
}
```

It will ALWAYS output `Python 3.10.9`!

---

Docker (I will not introduce it) on the other hand has a `Dockerfile` format:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.14

RUN apk add --no-cache python3

CMD [ "python" "--version" ]
```

---

You can build one image with a `Dockerfile`! But running `docker build` later may produce a different image.

---

So, you have to distribute the image (that could be heavy) rather than the `Dockerfile` to ensure reproducibility …

---

Do you know there is a Nix docker image? \footnote{https://hub.docker.com/r/nixos/nix}

You could enter a Nix environment in it!

---

```Dockerfile
FROM nixos/nix

RUN nix-shell --pure -p python3 -I \
    nixpkgs="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/\
9402c27069da5c5217648ec9cfe6d437aeadb79d.tar.gz"

CMD [ "python" "--version" ]
```

But, the size of our image is 1.2Gb ...

---

Docker images have a state, that could be mutated, sometimes nobody knows how to rebuild a modified image ...

---

However, we can do better: generate docker image out of Nix file!

The image will not contain Nix or any package manager, it will actually contain only what it really needs to run, so it could be smaller than Alpine ;)

---

```nix
let hash = "9402c27069da5c5217648ec9cfe6d437aeadb79d";
in { pkgs ? import (fetchTarball
  "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/${hash}.tar.gz")
  { system = "x86_64-linux"; } }:

pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage {
  name = "my-image";
  config = { Cmd = [ "${pkgs.python3}/bin/python" ]; };
}
```

---

Now our image size is 53.5Mb! (VS 52.4Mb for Alpine Linux)

N.b. Nix also support layered images, and can even stream them!

---

Is it hard to turn an existing `Dockerfile` into a Nix expression?

Yes, it's switching from an imperative model to a declarative one …

---

But I'm starting to experiment with an interactive CLI that would help user to step
by step do the rewriting.

Please ping me if that would be something that interest you!

---

\Huge Thank you

`impressive` is the ignite talk CLI tool suggested by CfgMgtCamp organizer:

```
nix-shell -p impressive
error: impressive has been removed due to lack of
released python 2 support and maintainership in nixpkgs
```

It's so easy to contribute to `nixpkgs` (~ 5000 contributors), give it a try!
