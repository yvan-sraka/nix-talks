Hey, hello, I'm Yvan.

I'm involved in some local repair cafés/hackerspaces, and maybe you're aware that the EOL of Windows 10 is near, when I put Linux on older machines, I choose NixOS: it's hard to break, atomic, reproducible, blablabla. But there's no LTS; or maybe the sponsor near the door of the aula might disagree.

So, I expect users to end up with something homologous to a Chromebook, where they never have to touch their configuration and it keep working and be updated forever. In my scenario, they use the default installer, the graphical one so they choose autonomously their language/keymap/password, etc. (again I know NixOS-anywhere/disko is great, I just don't want to handle installation of new machines myself)

Then I have a script that enables my thing. You can look at it; the code is really small. It just changes the default nixos channel to one that wraps the last stable. I have some PoC CI that checks the channel against some older potential configuration.nix generated by the installer.

In my wrapper, I can work around the options that got deprecated. And It's not like every six months we have to do the full release notes, but just theoretically the few options that could be found in a configuration generated by the default installer, which seems easily doable.

Indeed, that's the right place to define the defaults you want to enforce. Like what I think is great to have on a laptop. But it's also a tool I would love to have in any organization to manage a lot of computers easily. Hacking with channels was a funny idea, but maybe I could have made a rnix-parser-based thing or have nix-manipulator that automatically modifies the user config, I just didn't go that road.

That's all, folks! Thanks for listening, and feel free to reach out on Mastodon, the social network of the cool kids.
